# Vehicle Parts Image Scraper

This project is an image scraper script designed to retrieve full-resolution images of vehicle parts. It processes reference codes from a custom Excel dataset, performs Google Image searches for each code, and downloads the images. It then creates a new dataset that includes the URLs of the downloaded images along with their corresponding reference codes.
